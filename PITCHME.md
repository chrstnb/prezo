### my experiences with it & how you can give it a try

## A little about me
- undergrad computer engineering student at the university of washington in seattle

- interned at google this past summer

- started programming about a year ago (though I wish I'd started sooner!)

## Why you should try programming
- **There are tons of applications in every field**; you can use it in areas you're passionate about even if they're not not directly in the realm of technology
