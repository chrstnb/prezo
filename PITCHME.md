# Computer Science
### my experiences with it & how you can give it a try

---
## A little about me
- Undergrad computer engineering student at the university of washington in seattle

- Interned at google this past summer

- Started programming about a year ago (though I wish I'd started sooner!)

---
## Why you should try programming
- **There are tons of applications in every field**; you can use it in areas you're passionate about even if they're not not directly in the realm of technology

- If you like math, there are a lot of things you'll love in Computer Science; it's built on math!

- If you don't *love* math, that's okay too!

## How you can try programming
### At school
- Consider taking computer science and web programming classes

- Try robotics!

- Join the Cyber Patriots club!

- Try to integrate some programming into your coursework, like using Processing (more on the next slide) in an art class or making a cool data visualization for a presentation

## Things you can try on your own
- Anything from [Beyond CS First](https://www.cs-first.com/en/beyond-cs-first)

- Courses on [Lynda.com](www.lynda.com)
  * Use your Mid-Continent Public Library card for free access! ðŸ˜‰

- Make a personal site on [Github](github.com)
  * The [JMcglone tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) is especially good
